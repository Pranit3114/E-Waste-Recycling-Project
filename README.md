# ♻️ E-Waste Recycling Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

The **E-Waste Recycling Platform** is a full-stack web application designed to manage and promote responsible disposal and recycling of electronic waste. The platform connects **users, organizations, and recycling centers** to facilitate the collection, tracking, and recycling of electronic devices.

The goal of the project is to provide a **digital solution to the growing problem of electronic waste** by enabling users to submit e-waste recycling requests and allowing organizations to manage device recycling efficiently.

# 🚨 Problem Statement

Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest-growing waste streams in the world. Improper disposal of electronic devices leads to:

* Environmental pollution
* Toxic chemical leakage
* Loss of valuable recyclable materials
* Health hazards

Many people do not know **where or how to dispose of their old electronics responsibly**.

---

# 💡 Proposed Solution

This platform provides a **centralized system** where:

* Users can register and submit e-waste recycling requests
* Organizations can manage device collection
* Recycling centers can track and process e-waste
* Administrators can monitor recycling activity

The platform helps ensure **proper disposal, tracking, and recycling of electronic waste**.
